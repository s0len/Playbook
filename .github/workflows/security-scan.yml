name: Security Scan

# This workflow performs security vulnerability scanning on:
# 1. Pull requests - gates merges via required status checks
# 2. Pushes to develop/main - provides early detection
# 3. Weekly schedule - catches newly disclosed vulnerabilities
# 4. Manual triggers - for ad-hoc security audits
#
# Note: The build-and-push workflow also runs these scans before deploying
# to ensure vulnerable code never reaches production.
