# Changelog

The canonical changelog lives at [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/s0len/playbook/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md). Keeping it at the repo root makes it visible on GitHub releases while this page surfaces it in the docs sidebar.

Latest releases:

- [View `CHANGELOG.md` on GitHub](https://github.com/s0len/playbook/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
- Grab historical tags from the [releases page](https://github.com/s0len/playbook/releases)

> Tip: when landing a feature, update both `CHANGELOG.md` and the relevant `docs/` page so releases stay traceable.
