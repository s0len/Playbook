Project: Playbook v1.4.2 NHL File Processing Fixes
Workspace: /Users/solen/GitHub/Playbook
Spec: 032-1-4-2-develop-run-issues
Started: 2026-01-08

Workflow Type: investigation
Rationale: This task requires investigation of three distinct failure modes before implementing fixes:
           (1) AttributeError crash in destination_builder.py,
           (2) NHL season resolution failure for date-based patterns,
           (3) team name pollution from quality metadata.
           The error logs provide symptoms but not root causes. This is diagnostic work followed by targeted bug fixes.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Completed deep codebase investigation
- Analyzed matcher.py, destination_builder.py, processor.py
- Identified root causes for all three failures:
  * AttributeError: PatternConfig passed instead of PatternRuntime to build_destination()
  * Season resolution: Date mode doesn't construct date from day/month/year groups
  * Team names: Quality metadata not stripped from away/home captures
- Created implementation_plan.json with 5 phases, 11 subtasks
- Created init.sh setup script
- Created build-progress.txt tracking document

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 (Reproduce & Analyze Failures): 3 investigation subtasks - document root causes
- Phase 2 (Fix Critical AttributeError): 2 implementation subtasks - fix crash in processor.py
- Phase 3 (Fix NHL Season Resolution): 2 implementation subtasks - implement date-to-season conversion
- Phase 4 (Fix Team Name Extraction): 2 implementation subtasks - apply _strip_team_noise() to teams
- Phase 5 (Integration Testing): 2 integration subtasks - verify end-to-end with exact test files

Services Involved:
- main: All file processing, matching, and metadata handling (Python CLI application)

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 2
- Recommended workers: 1 (investigation phase blocks initial parallelism)
- Parallel groups: Phase 3 (season fix) and Phase 4 (team fix) can run in parallel after investigation
- Speedup estimate: 1.3x faster than sequential

Key Technical Findings:
1. AttributeError Root Cause:
   - Function: build_destination() in destination_builder.py line 112
   - Expected: PatternRuntime (which has .config attribute)
   - Receiving: PatternConfig (no .config attribute)
   - Fix location: processor.py line ~472 where build_destination() is called

2. Season Resolution Root Cause:
   - Function: _select_season() date mode in matcher.py lines 338-349
   - Problem: Looks for unified 'date' group, but regex extracts day/month/year separately
   - Solution: Use _parse_date_from_groups() to construct date from components
   - NHL season logic: October-June spans two calendar years (2025-01-07 → 2025-2026)

3. Team Name Pollution Root Cause:
   - Function: match_file_to_episode() in matcher.py line ~956
   - Problem: Regex captures quality tags as part of team names
   - Solution: Apply existing _strip_team_noise() function (lines 696-712) to away/home after extraction
   - Example: "Utah Mammoth 720p60_EN_Utah16" → "Utah Mammoth"

Test Files from GitHub Issue #86:
- NHL 07-01-2025 RS Ottawa Senators vs. Utah Mammoth 720p60_EN_Utah16.mkv
- NHL 07-01-2026 RS St Louis Blues vs Chicago Blackhawks 1080p60_EN_TNT.mkv
- NHL 07-01-2026 RS San Jose Sharks vs. Los Angeles Kings 720p60_EN_FDSNW.mkv

Success Criteria:
[ ] All three test files process without AttributeError
[ ] Season resolves to 2025-2026 for 2025-01-07 date
[ ] Team names extracted without quality metadata
[ ] All existing tests pass (no regressions in F1, NBA, NFL, etc.)
[ ] New unit tests added for date-to-season conversion
[ ] New unit tests added for team name cleaning
[ ] Integration test with exact GitHub Issue #86 filename passes

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  cd /Users/solen/GitHub/Playbook
  source .venv/bin/activate
  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 032-1-4-2-develop-run-issues --parallel 1

Or run init.sh first:

  cd /Users/solen/GitHub/Playbook/.auto-claude/specs/032-1-4-2-develop-run-issues
  ./init.sh

=== END SESSION 1 ===

Session 2 (Implementation - subtask-1-1):
- COMPLETED Investigation: AttributeError in destination_builder.py
- Identified TWO distinct locations where PatternConfig is incorrectly passed instead of PatternRuntime:

  Location 1 - Regex Matching Path (matcher.py:1078):
    Current: "pattern": pattern_runtime.config  # Returns PatternConfig ❌
    Fix:     "pattern": pattern_runtime         # Returns PatternRuntime ✓

  Location 2 - Structured Filename Matching Path (matcher.py:845 + 873):
    Current: pattern = PatternConfig(...)       # Creates bare PatternConfig ❌
    Fix:     pattern = PatternRuntime(          # Wraps in PatternRuntime ✓
               config=PatternConfig(...),
               regex=re.compile(".*"),
               session_lookup=SessionLookupIndex(),
             )

- Root cause: build_destination() expects PatternRuntime (which has .config attribute)
              but receives PatternConfig (which has no .config attribute)
- Call chain documented: processor.py:310 → :326 → :331 → :472 → destination_builder.py:112
- Created investigation-notes-subtask-1-1.md with complete analysis
